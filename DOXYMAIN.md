# MMArduinoHProt

Micro-Manager Arduino Device Driver using a low-latency communication protocol.

This library uses C++11 templates extensively. The default Visual Studio 2010 install doesn't work. 
You will need at least Visual Studio 2013 to build device drivers using this method. 
The current version of MM and the device adapters need some tweaking to 
build with VisualStudio 2013.
